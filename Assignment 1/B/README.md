## LAB 1 B (COL216)

- For the first question, for finding the combinatorial of N and R, we compute the factorials of N, R, and N-R and divide
  them to get the correct answer.

- For second question, the part A implements tail recursion, B implements simple recursion and C implements the iterative version of the same. A plot for the same has been derived from data.csv and plotted by plot.py.

- For the third question, when prompted for input, it will be of the form "[ add | sub | mul | div ] {num1} {num2}" This should compute correct answer unless the output range lies outside the range of the architecture.
