# COL216

Personal repository for COL216 assignments - pardon mistakes!

## Assignments Overview

- **Assignment 0** - To implement booth multiplier (variable latency multiplier) and compare efficiency and performance with fixed latency multiplier.

- **Assignment 1** - Implement simple RISC-V programs in RARS. Comparison of performance between recursion, tail recursion and loops in assembly language.

- **Assignment 2** - Implement the RISC-V single cycle processor, building from a ripple carry adder to ALU to Register File to the main Decode Unit and Memory of the processor.

- **Assignment 3** - Make a cache simulator for L1 cache with two possible replacement policies - LRU and FIFO. Identify the best cache combination. Figure out cache parameters from a given code performance.
